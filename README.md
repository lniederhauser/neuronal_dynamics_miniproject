# Neuronal Dynamics Miniproject
### Pyramidal Neurons Multiplex Dendritic and Somatic Signals via Spikes and Bursts

This project was done in the context of the NX-465 class at EPFL. We implemented different models to understand how pyramidal neurons integrate and distribute information.

-- helpers.py contains all of the functions necessary to replicate our work

-- main.ipynb is the jupyter notebook in which we defined constants and ran all of the simulations for the mandatory part of the project

-- bonus.ipynb is the jupyter notebook in which we defined constants and ran all of the simulations for the bonus part of the project

Dependencies:

-- brian2

-- numpy

-- matplotlib

-- neurodynex3
